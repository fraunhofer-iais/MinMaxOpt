# MinMaxOpt

With this code, you can reproduce results for the Paper "Bayesian Optimization for Min Max Optimization", published at the Workshop on Real World Experiment Design and Active Learning at ICML 2020.

Please note that the algorithms require initializations created using the file create_initializations.py. This can be done with any of the provided environments. To run the algorithms, create appropriate environments for either Entropy Search, using the environment_ES.yml file, or the environment_KG_TS_B.yml file.
